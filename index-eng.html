      <p> Hey! When I was little, I lost sight in one eye and hearing in one ear. I don't really remember life before that, so I'm not sure how everyone else sees the world. Oh well, you can only work with what you've got. I think I compensate for my lack of sensory awareness by constantly living in the most fantastical made-up world inside my head - it's quite fun. </p>
      
      <p>For most of my life, my plan was clearly laid out. I went to uni to study Mandarin Chinese & Spanish, and planned to continue working on becoming a well-rounded and experienced human being. I wanted to spend a good chunk of time in Madrid and Shanghai, but I was - and remain - open to any other Spanish or Mandarin speaking cities. Obviously, I couldn't go anywhere or do anything when I graduated in 2020.  </p>

      <p> I ended up getting a job in welfare-to-work, working with councils to support unemployed people. This career wasn't a good fit for me. I am ambitious, impatient and have a low tolerance for boredom. My sister then suggested I follow her into tech, where salaries are high, job perks are fun and opportunities are as varied as they are interesting. That’s why I’m here  </p>
